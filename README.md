# Alreviews

This is a flask application that implements a rating system for albums. The application uses the AudioDB api to gather information
about albums by an sertain artist and gives the user questions with which every song and the entire album as a whole is rated.

## Problem statement

After listening to an album most of the times my friends ask me what I think of it and all i can answer is "I liked it" or "I hated it". With this application I'd like to create a way to be more critical with the albums I listen to and formulate a better oppinion about albums I've listened to in the past.

## Solution description

With the app I will be able to look up a sertain album by an artist, answer questions about what I thought about a song and the entire album and this will generate a grade and this will be added to a list of albums I've graded before.

## Data sources

The data sources that will be used to gather the needed information are:

- The AudioDB API: to gather information about an album (https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php?ref=apilist.fun)

## External components

To implement this application I will be using:

- Flask: to create the server
- SQLalchemy: to create the database
- Bootstrap/CSS: to style the application

## Details and sketches

This part describes different ways that your application will be used, with all relevant screens sketched out
